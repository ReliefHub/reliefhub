Setup
-----

    bundle install
    rake db:create
    rake db:migrate
    rake

You should see a chain of satisfying green dots.

Dependencies
------------

Gems are managed by Bundler. Database is Postgres to match Heroku.

Mac:

    brew install postgres

Ubuntu:

    sudo apt-get install postgres

This should install a postgres/postgres UNIX account.
Then, make sure the postgres/postgres user is set up for the database server.

    su - postgres
    psql
    \password postgres

Our config/database.yml uses these postgres/postgres credentials.

Deploy
------

Deploy to Heroku, rake db:migrate, and notify Hoptoad of deploy:

    rake deploy

Deploys to staging by default. When ready for production:

    rake deploy:production

Continuous Integration
----------------------

Commits to origin master (Github) will notify CI of the build.
