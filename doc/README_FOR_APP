    rake

Dependencies
------------

Gems are managed by Bundler. Database is Postgres to match Heroku.

If you're on a Mac, install Postgres with Homebrew:

    brew install postgres

Then, go into System Preferences > Accounts and
create a new "postgres" user with password "postgres"

We don't set a username or password in development or test environments. Instead, create postgres database role (user) with the same handle as your unix username. To create the postgres user, try (your password will be prompted):

    sudo -u postgres createuser --no-superuser --createdb --no-createrole --login --pwprompt --encrypted -h 127.0.0.1 -p 5432 $YOUR_UNIX_USERNAME$
