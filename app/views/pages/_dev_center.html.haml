%h2 Development Center
%p When a developer, or set of developers, contributes code to the collective commons, society benefits. The ReliefHub open source community has developed a helpful kind of software and is happy to share it with the development community. In our best efforts to remain totally transparent, we hope to provide our users with a visible and streamlined experience when choosing our platform. 
Beyond our users, we aim to provide the source to our web-based funding framework so that others in the development community may view and apply it in areas that we alone cannot reach. By remaining open source, we hope to inspire and perpetuate world-wide relief for all those outside of our grasp. Our ultimate goal is to provide a solution and there is no better means of creating positive change than creating it together. We invite all prospects to discuss our framework either with us personally or with any other audience so that we may continue to improve and develop our foundation for the better.
