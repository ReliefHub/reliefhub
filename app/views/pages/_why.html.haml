  1. Community Influenced Decision Making
%p Working with our community we will run ReliefHub similar to Wikipedia so individuals can give feedback and influence the decision making process.

  2. Self-Sustaining
%p Our goal is to become self-sustaining by our 5th birthday. We will continuously work with our community to develop the best approach possible in order to allow our framework to remain largely effective while requiring minimal resources.

  3. Total Transparency
%p Ever wonder what happens to your dollars after you make a donation?  Our goal is to make it completely visible by publishing our detailed budgets and financial reports on our website for everyone to review. We aim to leave no trail of ambiguity between your generosity and those which YOU want to reach out to but rather play a mere vessel for such acts of selflessness.

  4. Open Source
%p We leverage open source technologies to build and maintain ReliefHub.org and will share all of our innovations including processes, product roadmap, and software so others in the non-profit community can benefit and build from our platform.
